# Street-View-House-Number-Detection-Using-CNN
In this project, we aim to develop a Convelutional Neural Netwrk platform, as a Deep Learning algorithm, to detect the house numbers using the MNIST dataset. We could achieve 95% accuracy in the training process and also compared our algorithm with a Fully Connected Layer, placing an emphasis on the reliabality of the network.
